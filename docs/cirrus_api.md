We studied multiple [autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) models using [the **explorer** app](https://github.com/bearloga/wmf-discovery-forecasting/tree/master/explorer), and settled on ARIMA(0,1,2)x(2,1,1) w/ period of 7 as the best one -- decided by [Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion).

We also have a competing model that uses [Bayesian structural time series (BSTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_structural_time_series), with weekly and monthly seasonalities and U.S. holiday effects.
